## Philosophy
Balance professional presentation with authentic hobby band charm. We want to look credible and bookable while staying true to being a passionate Green Day tribute band that does this for the love of the music.

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

### 1. Color Palette Update
- **Current:** Generic green (#4caf50)
- **Change to:** Punk-inspired palette
  - Primary: Bold red (#e31e24 or similar)
  - Secondary: Black (#1a1a1a)
  - Accents: White, dark gray
  - Keep green as subtle accent only
- **Why:** Instantly more authentic to Green Day's aesthetic

### 2. Add Bold Tagline/Subtitle
- English: "Your favorite Green Day hits, live and authentic"
- German: "Deine Lieblings-Green Day Hits, live und authentisch"
- Place under the main logo or in About section
- **Tone:** Enthusiastic but not over-the-top

### 3. Better Call-to-Action Buttons
- Replace generic "Get in Touch" with "Book Brain Stew"
- Add timeline without being pushy: "Now booking for 2026"
- Style: Bold, slightly punk-edged (not corporate rounded)
- Alternative: "Available for bookings" (timeless option)

## Visual Identity & Branding

### Typography Improvements
**Headers:**
- Replace Arial with bold, impactful fonts
- Options: Montserrat Bold, Oswald, Bebas Neue
- Keep them readable, add subtle character

**Body Text:**
- Keep clean and readable (Open Sans or Roboto)
- Slightly larger font size (current is fine, maybe bump 1-2px)

### Design Elements
**Add subtle punk touches:**
- Slight texture overlays on backgrounds (very subtle concrete/paper)
- Hand-drawn style dividers between sections
- Grunge borders on buttons (optional, don't overdo)
- Keep it clean - enhance, don't distract

**Background Variations:**
- Alternate section backgrounds: light gray, off-white, subtle pattern
- Avoid pure white everywhere - adds depth
